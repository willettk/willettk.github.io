<h1>Teaching</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I have a keen interest in teaching as well as research. In the classroom, I'm an advocate for lecture-tutorials, pair-share learning, and the use of clickers/vote response systems as valuable educational tools. 

<h2>Courses</h2>

<ul>
<li>I taught PHYS 1101 (Introductory College Physics I) at UMN in the spring of 2014. The course focused on mechanics (without calculus) for a 175-person class of non-majors. Syllabus and content can be found on the <a href=http://bit.ly/PHYS1101>class webpage</a>.</li>
<li>I taught ASTR 1110 (The Solar System) at CU in the summer of 2009. As the instructor of record, I gave all lectures, wrote homework assignments and exams, and directed external activities including observing nights at the telescope.</li>
<li>As a graduate student, I taught two lab sections of the honors Introduction to Astronomy course at CU, as well as two lab sections of the standard Introduction to Astronomy. I rewrote the solution manual for the honors course and co-developed a new lab exercise using small, handheld refractor telescopes.</li>
</ul>
