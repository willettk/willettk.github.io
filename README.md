- [ ] migrate content for `scoop.html`
- [ ] migrate posts from old pelican blog?
- [ ] set an automatic makefile for publishing, including pushing to master (see [tutorial](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)); possible [useful link](https://clamytoe.github.io/articles/2020/Feb/28/pelican/)
- [ ] add documentation to this README

    * [elegant theme](https://elegant.oncrashreboot.com/)
    * [ghp-import](https://github.com/c-w/ghp-import)
    * [tablesort](https://github.com/tristen/tablesort/); could not get this to work correctly with submodules
